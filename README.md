<p align="center"> Like Hacking for Dummies | But Better </p>

<hr/>

<p>A website that allows the user to use many common hacking scripts, normally only executable in the terminal, based on
a simple GUI. The GUI is designed that it's understandable for everybody. There are 2 different Mode's.
<br>
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td style="width: 300px; text-align: left">Simple Mode </td>
        <td style="width: 300px">This is the simple mode. Every Person should be able to use the Website in this mode. 
        And the best Thing is that you don't even lose any functionality. It's just maybe a little faster for more 
        experienced people to use the Advanced Mode</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="width: 300px">Advanced Mode</td>
        <td style="width: 300px">This is the Advanced Mode. The interface may look very complicated at the first look, 
        but with a little training and know-how, this interface can also be mastered very quickly and efficient.</td>
    </tr>
