<h2 id="using-nmap">Using Nmap</h2>
<p>Nmap has a lot of features, but getting started is as easy as running <code>nmap
scanme.nmap.org</code>. Running <code>nmap</code> without any parameters will give a helpful
list of the most common options, which are discussed in depth in <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man.html">the man
page</a>. Users who prefer a graphical interface
can use the included <a href="https://nmap.org/zenmap/">Zenmap front-end</a>.</p>
